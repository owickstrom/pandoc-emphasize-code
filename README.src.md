subtitle: A Pandoc filter for emphasizing code in fenced blocks.

## Usage

Often when working with code examples in documentation, printed or web hosted,
or in presentation slideshows, you might want to emphasize parts of a code
snippet.

You can get away with manually writing the target markup, in LaTeX or raw HTML,
but if you want to render the same document in multiple output formats, this
gets really tedious. Also, having to write the markup by hand can be error
prone.

This filter lets you specify *ranges* of a code block to emphasize, and have
the filter generate the appropriate markup for you. It recognizes code blocks
with the `emphasize` attribute present:

````{emphasize=1:14-1:35}
```{.haskell emphasize=2-2,3:3-3:12}
myFunc = do
  newStuffHere
  andThisToo notThis
  notSoRelevant
```
````

The rendered output looks like this (if you're on GitHub, see the [rendered
output](https://owickstrom.github.io/pandoc-emphasize-code/) online):

```{.haskell emphasize=2-2,3:3-3:12}
myFunc = do
  newStuffHere
  andThisToo notThis
  notSoRelevant
```

Currently, the following output formats are supported:

* HTML (`html` and `html5`)
* LaTeX (`latex` and `beamer`)
* GitHub-Flavored Markdown (`markdown_github`)
* RevealJS (`revealjs`)

### Syntax

The value of the `emphasize` attribute is a comma-separated list of *ranges*.
A *range* consists of either two positions or two line numbers, separated by a
dash. A *position* consists of a *line number* and a *column number*, separated
by a colon.

The syntax can be described in EBNF, like so:

``` ebnf
line number     = natural number;
column number   = natural number;
position        = line number, ":", column number;
range           = position, "-", position
                | line number, "-", line number;
ranges          = range, { (",", range) };

(* definition of natural number excluded for brevity *)
```

There must be at least one range in the comma-separated list. A range can
span multiple lines. For ranges composed of line numbers, the start and end
columns are assumed to be the first and last column on that line.

### Rendering to HTML

The code block above would render HTML output like the following (lines broken
for readability):

``` html
<pre class="haskell"><code>myFunc = do
<mark class="block">  newStuffHere</mark>
  <mark class="inline">andThisToo</mark> notThis
  notSoRelevant</code></pre>
```

When rendering to `html5` or `revealjs`, the emphasized ranges are wrapped in
`<mark>` tags.  The default browser styling is black text on yellow background,
but can be customized with CSS:

``` css
code mark {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
```

The `html` and `markdown_github` output formats use `<em>` tags instead of
`<mark>` tags.  By default, `<em>` tags are rendered in italic type, but can be
customized with CSS:

``` css
code em {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

If you want to achieve the same "entire line" highlighting effect seen in the
above examples, you'll also want to add these styles:

``` css
pre > code {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  min-width: 100%;
  z-index: 1;
}

mark.block::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  background-color: yellow;
  z-index: -1;

  /**
   * Adjust these sizes to work with your code blocks.
   * For example, you can set left & right to be negative
   * if you have padding on your code blocks.
   */
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 1.5rem;
}
```

**NOTE:** There is no additional syntax highlighting when emphasizing code and
rendering to HTML, as there is no way to use Pandoc's highlighter and embed
custom HTML tags. You can usually recover language-based syntax highlighting
with a JavaScript syntax highlighter running in the browser on page load (for
example: [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)).

### Rendering with LaTeX

When rendering using LaTeX, two things are required:

* The `listings` package needs to be included.
* You need to define a `CodeEmphasis` and `CodeEmphasisLine` command, styling
  the emphasized code in `lstlisting`s.

If you're not using a custom LaTeX template, you can use the YAML front matter
in a Markdown source file to add the requirements:

``` yaml
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{listings}
  - \lstset{basicstyle=\ttfamily}
  - \newcommand{\CodeEmphasis}[1]{\textcolor{red}{\textit{#1}}}
  - \newcommand{\CodeEmphasisLine}[1]{\textcolor{red}{\textit{#1}}}
```

**NOTE:** When rendering as Beamer slides, any frame including an emphasized
block must be marked as `fragile`:

```` markdown
## My Slide {.fragile}

```{.haskell emphasize=2:3-2:14,3:3-3:12}
myFunc = do
  newStuffHere
  andThisToo notThis
  notSoRelevant
```
````

### Regular Highlighting

You can still use regular Pandoc highlighting (the *skylighting* library):

    ``` {.haskell}
    myFunc :: The Type -> Signature
    myFunc = do
      newStuffHere
      andThisToo notThis
      notSoRelevant
    ```

It gives you all the nice colors:

``` haskell
myFunc :: The Type -> Signature
myFunc = do
  newStuffHere
  andThisToo notThis
  notSoRelevant
```

The drawback is that you have two different highlighting systems now, one
for emphasized code, one for regular code blocks.

## Install

Executables for Linux and macOS are available in the [Releases
page](https://github.com/owickstrom/pandoc-emphasize-code/releases).

### From Hackage

If you'd rather install using `cabal` or `stack`, you can use the following
command:

``` sh
cabal install pandoc-emphasize-code
```

The package is [available at Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-emphasize-code).

## Build

Requirements:

* [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) or
  [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), either works.

To install from sources, run:

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:owickstrom/pandoc-emphasize-code.git
cd pandoc-emphasize-code
stack setup
stack install
```

To build the example in `README.src.md`, make sure you have on your `PATH`:

- `pandoc` (`stack build pandoc`)
- `pdflatex` (can be obtained from a [Tex distribution](https://ctan.org/starter), on macOS `brew cask install mactex` then add `/Library/TeX/texbin` to your `PATH`)

Then run:

``` sh
make
```

## Run

If you have installed from sources, and you have `~/.local/bin` on your
`PATH`, you can use the filter with Pandoc like so:

``` sh
pandoc --filter pandoc-emphasize-code input.md output.html
```

## Usage with Hakyll

If you are using the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site generator, you can use the filter by importing it as a library and using the snippet below.

Add `pandoc`, `pandoc-types`, and `pandoc-emphasize-code` to your project dependencies, then define a custom Hakyll compiler using a Pandoc transform:

```haskell
import Text.Pandoc (Format (..), Pandoc)
import Text.Pandoc.Walk (walkM)
import Text.Pandoc.Filter.EmphasizeCode (emphasizeCode)

emphasizeCodeTransform :: Pandoc -> IO Pandoc
emphasizeCodeTransform = walkM (emphasizeCode (Just (Format "html5")))

emphasizeCodePandocCompiler :: Compiler (Item String)
emphasizeCodePandocCompiler =
  pandocCompilerWithTransformM
    defaultHakyllReaderOptions
    defaultHakyllWriterOptions {writerHighlightStyle = Nothing}
    (unsafeCompiler . emphasizeCodeTransform)
```

You can now use `emphasizeCodePandocCompiler` instead of the default `pandocCompiler` in your Hakyll rules:

```haskell
match "*.md" $ do
  route $ setExtension "html"
  compile $ emphasizeCodePandocCompiler
    >>= loadAndApplyTemplate "templates/default.html" defaultContext
    >>= relativizeUrls
```
